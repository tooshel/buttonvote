# button vote

== Made by Sheldon for Trish. 

Trish: "Hey Sheldon! I loved that button you made for your <a href="https://www.hallowingo.com/">Hallowingo</a> app. You think we could use buttons for a voting app on our Pi Day Event?"  

Me: Maybe! Let me see if bootstrap and jquery are still around!

Use a bit of Arduino code to turn an arduion into a keyboard. And have it send a keyboard event when pressed. Or just press the vote buttons below.</p>




Things to know:

 - The votes are saved! So if you reload on accident on the same machine, your votes are still there
 - You can use 1,2,3,4,5 from the top of your keyboard (not numpad . . . numpads are wack) to vote too. That's how I can tie in a usb connected button with an arduino board no problem.
